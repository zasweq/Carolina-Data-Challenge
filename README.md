# Carolina-Data-Challenge

I participated in the Carolina Data Challenge this year, and this shows off the project I worked on in a group of two. Our project was the visualzation of death rates of different diseases across the country and grouped by state.
I cleaned the csv file given to us in the competition using Python and the pandas library.
The Dataset provided was a CSV with 10296 rows, with the year, 113 cause name, cause name, state, deaths, and age adjusted death rate. The data was contained from 1999-2015.
One of the things I had to do was remove columns we did not want to visualize from the dataset, which were 113 cause name and age adjusted
death rate.
I also had to check if the data had equality
